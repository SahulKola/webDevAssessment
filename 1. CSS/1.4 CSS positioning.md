# CSS positioning

1.  Create a page with two `<div>` elements.
2.  Add a `class` attribute to the first `<div>` tag, with the value `box-one`.
3.  Add a `class` attribute to the second `<div>` tag, with the value `box-two`.
4.  Add a CSS rule that makes elements with either `class` `box-one` or `box-two` have a `width` and `height` of `200px`, and a `color` of `white`.
5.  Add a CSS rule that gets rid of the default spacing that is built-in to the main document container.
6.  Add a CSS rule that gives elements with a `class` of `box-one` a `red` `background`.
7.  Add a CSS rule that gives elements with a `class` of `box-two` a `blue` `background`.
8.  Modify a single existing rule such that the page looks exactly like this (text content can be different). The second box is 20px from the top and left of the first box:
